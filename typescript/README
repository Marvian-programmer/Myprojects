# It's a language that was created to address the shortcomings of javascript.
# typescript is a superset of javascript meaning it builds on top of javascript.
# It more of a statically-typed language meaning errors are caught at compile unlike javascript which
# is a dynamically-typed language.


## Drawbacks
# Since most browsers don't understand typescript the compiler needs to transpilate ts code into js code (Transpilation)
# Discipline in coding.


## Production Environments
# ts is more ideal for medium to large projects and js for small projects.
