# Overview

#### With this personal project, I attended to design a Grading Rubric for all Teaching Assistants and Tutors I hire for at my current Job on Campus at BYU-I as a hiring Assistant. Currentlt we are using google Docs. So, I want to automate the way we grade to mitigate data redundancy and improve accuracy.
#### I noticed that using ASP.net core framework will be ideal in making a web based grading rubric. But I wanted to learn the syntax for C# and I used the console to do that. Now that I know how the syntax works in C#. I am going to redo this software using .net core framework to design a more used friendly eeb base application for the department I am working for.
