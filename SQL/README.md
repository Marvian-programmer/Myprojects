# Overview

#### I have been working on programming in Java as a personal project. Teaching myself this langauage 
#### fun. For this part of my projects I am learning how to sue SQL in JAVA. My end goal is being able to input 
#### data in Java and then store it in a Database.

# SQL Database

### For this project I was using SQLite. I created a Database and inside I had three tables and their columns.
### I also had some data types associated with each column name to enforce data integrity. I also used primary keys 
### so that I could uniquely identify each record within my tables that way there will not be data redundancy.



# Development Environment

 * IntelliJ
 * DB Browser for SQLite
