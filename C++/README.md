# Overview

#### With this personal project, I was trying to design a software that I could use to store my family's marriage information such when they got married, where they got married and at what age they were married. Although, it is incomplete with the work i just did I can safely say I now have a rough idea of how classses and methods work in C++. I am hoping to continue learning more C++ going forward.

#### I was writing this software for the sole purpose of learning how coding in c++ is like. I really wantee to know how constructors and destructors work in C++ also and also how to seperate specifications and implimentations.
